# Titanic-Dataset-Exploratory-Data-Analysis-EDA-

This project performs an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the classic **Titanic dataset** provided by Kaggle. The goal is to understand the key patterns and relationships in the data that influence passenger survival.

---

## 📌 Objective

- Clean and explore the Titanic dataset
- Visualize important relationships using Python tools
- Gain insights into the factors affecting survival
- Summarize findings for further machine learning modeling

---

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy)
- **Visualization**: Seaborn, Matplotlib
- **Jupyter Notebook**

---

## 🔍 Key EDA Steps

1. **Loading & Inspecting the Dataset**
2. **Statistical Overview** using `.info()`, `.describe()`, and `.value_counts()`
3. **Data Cleaning** for null values
4. **Visual Analysis**:
    - Pairplots
    - Correlation Heatmap
    - Histograms
    - Boxplots
    - Scatterplots
5. **Observations** and Visual Insights
6. **Summary of Findings**

## 📊 Insights Gained

- **Survival strongly influenced by**:
  - **Sex** (Females had higher survival)
  - **Class** (1st class had higher survival rate)
  - **Fare** (Higher fares correlated with better survival)
  - **Age** (Children were more likely to survive)
- Embarked location and family size also played subtle roles.
